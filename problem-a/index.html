    <h1>Simon</h1>

    <p><a href="https://gurrenlagann.fandom.com/wiki/Simon">Simon</a> (no last name) is the main character of the anime <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurren_Lagann">Gurren Lagann</a></cite> which is also known as Tengen Toppa. He starts off as an innocent curious child in the anime series, but quickly becomes a great and honored leader. He goes through
    many challenges throughout the series which he perseveres. Most notably, the death of his beloved father/brother figure Kamina which ends up having a lasting impact on Simon. The character development he goes through in the span of only 27 episodes of this anime makes it truly a worthwhile watch.</p>
    <h2>I admire:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>His persistance and endurance; like many anime characters he never gives up and pushes through.</li>
        <li class="important">His style because it's on point!</li>
        <li>The bond he has with his friends and family is inspiring.</li>
    </ul>
